*we keep all the movies in an array ('movies'). The array increases length when we need to insert a 
movie but we don't have space. We know how many movies we have ('movies_num') and the length of
the array is 'sz' i.e how many bytes we have allocated.
*We always keep the movies array sorted by direcotrs surname.When the movies are 
loaded from disk and upon each insertion or deletion we apply quicksort.
